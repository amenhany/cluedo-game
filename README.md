# üé© Cluedo

A multiplayer board game, created with a webstack. But don't let that fool you as the game feels like a normal game, with a beautiful 1930s aesthetic inspired by Cuphead, and other vintage rubberhose styles.

This game was literally created because I wanted to play the game remotely with my friends but I couldn't find a good online version.
